All the engineering codes and open-source tools of the Holter-to-Sleep project

To facilitate practical use and result interpretation, we implemented an integrated web dashboard that combines ECG-based sleep inference with Holter-grade long-term ECG analytics. The system accepts raw EDF recordings, automatically parses the ECG channel, and generates a consolidated overnight report including continuous heart-rate trends, a sleep-stage timeline, and summary sleep and cardiac metrics, enabling unified review of nocturnal cardio--sleep phenotypes.
